#### About game

Game is based on one player and one ball. Goal is that paddle keeps ball bouncing around the screen, if ball doesn't hit paddle it's game over. New game start when player presses button for restart. There are also speed up and slow down buttons for paddle movement, in case player is far from the ball so he can catch up.

##### Controls

1. board move right "->"
2. board move left "<-"
3. restart "A"
4. speed up board "Z"
5. speed down board "B"

###### Function of moving ball

1. If board donesn't move, ball will continue to move in normal trajectrory.
2. if board moves in opposite direction compared to ball nothing really changes here

Plot twist is in the next segment
3. If board moves in the same direction as ball (left or right) ball will bounce in the way it came from.
